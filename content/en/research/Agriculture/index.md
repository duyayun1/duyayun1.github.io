summary = """
 Design and implement a low-cost (under $500) compact autonomous robot to navigate, localize itself, recognize and spray weeds, and get recharged in narrow spacing crop fields for several weeks:<br>
 1). [Design and fabrication]: Design and fabricate the robot incorporating water-jetting the chassis, lathing the axles, 3D printing component holders, and compromising;<br>
 2). [Computer vision]: Without accurate expensive GPS, we combined LiDAR, IMU, wheel encoders, and cameras (including visual odometry) to navigate and locate the robot;<br>
 3). [Deep learning]: Build our own weed dataset, develope and deploy convolutional neural networks (CNN) on our onboard embedded system, i.e. the robot to enable the robot to differentiate different weeds and spray the corresponding herbicides.<br>
