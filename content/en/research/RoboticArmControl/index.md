# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = """
Designed a compliant roller and implemented passive impedance control with vision that allows robots to realize human-level performance<br>
1). Proposed a framework enabling a robot with only position control to recognize the shape of 3D objects, and plan the coating trajectory autonomously;<br>
2). Used bare minimum ingredients to realize constant-force coating with a compliant roller, in conjunction with a cheap ultrasonic sensor.<br>
