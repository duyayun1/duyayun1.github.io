Hello, welcome to Yayun(Daisy) Du's website. I am a postdoc at Querrey Simpson Institute for Bioelectronics at Northwestern University, supervised by Prof. John Rogers. 
My future lab vision is safe, comfortable, and efficient human robot interaction. Born and raised in a Chinese rural village, I have been thinking about freeing labor with my parents being farmers. To this end, I chose robotics design and control as my research subject. As an interdisciplinary field, my robotic research involves system design (rigid/flexible PCB board design included), control, artificial intelligence, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and physics-based machine learning-assisted mechanics analysis.
