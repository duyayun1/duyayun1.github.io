Hello, welcome to the website of Yayun(Daisy) Du. I am a Ph.D. student in Robotics and Control with a minor in solid mechanics at UCLA. 
Born and raised in a rural village in China, and my parents are farmers, I've been dreaming about freeing labor. To this end, I chose robotics design and control as my research subject. As an interdisciplinary field, my robotic research involves system design (rigid/flexible PCB board design inlcuded), control, artificial intelligence, deep learning, and mechanics analysis.
With extraordinary leadership, I have been leading several projects since I started my Ph.D.. I fulfilled the autonomous robotic painting with rollers and made it possible for the robot to paint as well as human hand painting using constant force through passive impedance control. The work got accepted by IROS. I also developed a low-cost compact autonomous agriculture robot to realize weed control in plants with the path width as narrow as one foot. The final goal is to enable it to continue to work robustly in the fields for several weeks with autonomous recharging without human intervention. 

Apart from rigid robots, I am also interested in bio-inspired soft robots. Inspired by bacteria, I built flagellated robot prototypes that can swim in both granular medium and low Reynolds number fluid as well as a starfish robot that can swim in the water and wrote my own C++ simulator to simulate their movements faster than real time based on the Discrete Elastic Rods (DER) theory.

---
What I am doing Now?

- Finish developing algorithms that allow the robot to locate itself in the fields without GPS using visual odometry in conjunction with IMU and motor encoders;
- Make the self-recharging function of the agricultural robot more robust;
- Polish the adaptive weight distribution of the bacteria-inspired robot with the aim of verifying the bacterium's ability to turn by flagella buckling;
- In the tenure-track faculty job hunt.
