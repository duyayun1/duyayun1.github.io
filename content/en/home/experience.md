  Dir 1: Simple but functional soft robot inspired by bacteria
  Step 1: Design the simplest autonomous soft flagellated robot able to swim in granular media and fluids;
  Step 2: Write a discrete differential geometry (DDG)-based simulator, 10x-100x faster than real time to simulate the performance of soft flagellated robots; 
  Step 3: Collect massive data from robots and use machine learning to learn their locomotion and help with optimal robot design.
  Dir 2: Design and control an autonomous weed-control agricultural robot
